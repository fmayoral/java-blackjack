The `BlackJackCalculatorService` class demonstrates a straightforward application of several design principles rather than specific design patterns in the traditional sense. However, its implementation reveals adherence to principles such as **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**, which are foundational to clean and maintainable software design. Let's explore how these principles are applied:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Focused Functionality**: The `BlackJackCalculatorService` is dedicated to calculating the total value of a hand in a game of Blackjack, handling both player and dealer hands. By focusing on this single responsibility, the service adheres to SRP, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- **Code Reuse and Efficiency**: While the methods `playerHandTotal` and `dealerHandTotal` cater to slightly different rules (e.g., handling of soft 17s for the dealer), the core logic of summing card values and adjusting for aces is consistent. This demonstrates an effort to keep the implementation efficient and avoid unnecessary repetition. However, it's worth noting that there's still some repetition in how totals are calculated and adjusted, suggesting that there might be room for further refactoring to fully embrace the DRY principle.

### Potential for Strategy Pattern

- While not implemented as such, the class hints at a potential application of the **Strategy Pattern**. If the game rules for calculating hand totals were to vary more significantly (beyond just the handling of aces and soft 17s), encapsulating these calculation strategies in separate, interchangeable modules would allow for more flexible handling of different Blackjack variants or house rules.

### Observations

- **Functional Programming**: The method `dealerHandTotal` leverages Java's Stream API for a more functional programming approach to sum card values and count aces. This style can enhance readability and conciseness but is used alongside imperative style code in `playerHandTotal`, indicating a mix of paradigms that could be unified for consistency.

- **Logging for Transparency**: Extensive logging provides visibility into the calculation process, aiding in debugging and understanding the flow of calculations. This is a good practice, especially in complex logic that involves conditional adjustments.

### Conclusion

The `BlackJackCalculatorService` class primarily illustrates the application of SRP and DRY principles within the context of a service dedicated to calculating hand totals in Blackjack. While it does not explicitly implement a design pattern like Strategy or Command, its structure hints at ways these patterns could be applied for further refinement, especially in a more complex or variant-rich game logic scenario. The use of functional programming techniques and consistent logging also underscores the service's emphasis on clean, maintainable, and transparent code.
