The `BlackJackGameService` class demonstrates a clean implementation of several key software design principles and patterns, ensuring the service is well-structured, maintainable, and flexible. Here's a breakdown of the noteworthy patterns and practices identified:

### 1. Dependency Injection (DI)

- **Framework Utilization**: By leveraging Spring's `@Autowired` annotation, `BlackJackGameService` follows the Dependency Injection pattern to manage its dependencies. This approach decouples the service from the creation of its dependencies, such as `GameRepository`, `GameMapper`, `GameFactory`, and `ActionHandlingService`, enhancing modularity and testability.

### 2. Factory Pattern

- **Game Creation**: The use of `GameFactory` to instantiate new games is a classic example of the Factory Pattern. This pattern abstracts the instantiation logic into a dedicated factory, allowing for flexibility in the creation process and the potential for future expansion with different types of games or game initialization parameters.

### 3. Repository Pattern

- **Data Access**: The `GameRepository` serves as an abstraction layer over the underlying data store, encapsulating data retrieval and persistence. This pattern simplifies data access within the service, promoting a separation of concerns where the service focuses on business logic, not on data access specifics.

### 4. Adapter Pattern

- **Data Mapping**: The `GameMapper` component acts as an Adapter, transforming domain models (`BlackJackGame`) into API models (`Game`). This pattern facilitates the communication between the core logic of the application and the external API, ensuring that data can be easily translated between different formats or systems.

### 5. Strategy Pattern

- **Action Handling**: The delegation of action handling to `blackjackActionHandlingService` suggests a use of the Strategy Pattern. While not fully detailed in the provided code, it's implied that `blackjackActionHandlingService` could select and execute different strategies based on the `PlayerAction` it receives. This allows for a flexible handling of various actions without hardcoding the logic into the service itself.

### 6. Exception Handling

- **Custom Exceptions**: Utilizing custom exceptions like `GameNotFoundException` enhances error handling by providing more specific and meaningful error information. This practice aids in debugging and improves the user experience by offering clearer insights into what went wrong.

### 7. SOLID Principles

- **Adherence to SOLID**: Throughout its design, `BlackJackGameService` adheres to SOLID principles, especially:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class it interacts with has a clear and distinct responsibility.
    - **Open/Closed Principle**: The service is open for extension but closed for modification, particularly evident in how it handles game actions and mappings.
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions, as seen in its use of interfaces like `GameService` and `ActionHandlingService`.
      
**Note**: for a full list and explanation of SOLID principles see [Solid](SOLID.md).


### Conclusion

`BlackJackGameService` is a well-designed class that effectively utilizes design patterns and best practices to ensure its functionality is both robust and flexible. Through dependency injection, it achieves decoupling of its components; the factory pattern abstracts the game creation process; the repository pattern centralizes data access, and the adapter pattern facilitates data mapping. Furthermore, the potential use of the strategy pattern for action handling exemplifies how design patterns can be combined to address complex requirements in a clean, maintainable way.
